# SC Cosmetics Insights with AWS
This repository contains the code for a comphrehensive project that utilizes AWS to store and transform data to build optimized classification models. The objective is to increase customers propensity to purchase by analyzing cosmetic product shopping habits and integrating educational tools that dissuade customers from purchasing products with harmful chemical ingredients.

2. Run SC-Cosmetics.ipynb to copy S3 buckets and make the necessary data transformations.

## Abstract
People often go unaware that their cosmetic products contain potentially harmful chemicals and ingredients. SC Cosmetics provides a solution to help consumers identify harmful products and aims to increase customerâ€™s propensity to purchase clean cosmetics. 

## Problem Statement
The state of California requires the manufacturers of cosmetic products to report any products that contain cancer-causing or potentially hazardous ingredients to the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP). SC Cosmetics is an app that allows users to search or scan products to determine if it is free from potentially harmful ingredients. Additionally, there are filter options for the user to get recommendations and be introduced to new cosmetic products based on their skin type and preferences.

SC Cosmetics allows users to make purchases through links provided in the app, making clean products accessible. Not many people are taking advantage of this feature and our company aims to identify marketing and recommendation tactics that increase the number of people who place orders through the app.
